**Create a New Repository to Collaborate with others**

Now that you know how to create a repository (or refresh your memories), we are going to learn how to connect with others.

In this section, you are to find at least two other people in the class and create a repository. One person will create the repository and then add the others as collaborators.

1. Find the green "New repository" button and press it.

4. Give your repository a great name, like "_220-Collaboration_".
    - Optionally, give this repo a description, like "_This is how we share, Creative Coding 2 (MART220) course._".
5. Keep this as a "Public" repo.
6. Select the "Initialize this repository with a README" box.
7. Finally press the "Create Repository" button.

3. An email will be sent and the collaborator will need to accept.

**Pull from the repo and create content**

1. Just as before, the all collaborators can use GitHub Desktop or any other Git pull to get the respository.
2. However, instead of everyone pulling from main, each will create their own _branch_.

3. Now, each user can pull the code and it will in their branch.
4. Make sure you have chosen your branch in GitHub Desktop.
