# Homework

In this assignment, you are going to iterate on your first assignment and make it interactive (focus on keyboard or mouse for now).  Continue to use basic shapes to make it appear. Just make sure there is some basic movement as well.

Feel free to include any cultural representation if appropriate.

<!--
continue working with basic shapes in p5.js.  We are going to now formally incorporate control statements and variables. Whenever the program calls the draw method, keep track of the count. Every time the number exceeds a multiple of 1000, have your program change shapes and color. Put the shapes in random locations.
